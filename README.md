# PotatoDiseaseDetection
Developed a CNN model to classify potato diseases with over 90% accuracy,
distinguishing between healthy plants and diseases like early and late blight.
2. Implemented a 5-layer CNN, including convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers
and used 5000+ labelled images for image generalization.
3. Trained the model over 50 epochs using TensorFlow and Keras, with learning rate
scheduling and dropout regularization.
4. Deployed as an API via Flask for real-time detection through a web interface.
